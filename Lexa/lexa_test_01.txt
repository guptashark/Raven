This is some proper text. Not like that other garbage. Also, this should
handle... tabs! 

		Newlines! 




And spaces! 
          10 btw. 

If everything looks good, and this program is basically just cat, I think we
are good to go. 

And vim puts thing son differetn lines, but this program doesn't need to. 
It just echoes out what was in the file. So, That is that. Tada.
